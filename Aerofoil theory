\begin{exampleblock}{Flow Around an Aerofoil}
The flow around an aerofoil is equivalent to the superposition of a Uniform Flow at $\infty$ $(U_\infty)$ $+$ a continuous distribution of a clockwise free vortex on the camber line of \textbf{Circulation Density} $\gamma(s)$ per unit length.
\end{exampleblock}
The circulation density  $\gamma(s)$ is such that it forces the resultant flow to be tangent to the camber line at every point.\\

\begin{frame}
Consider the slope of the camber line to be small.\\
So,  \\
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\therefore \gamma(s)ds&=\gamma(\zeta)d\zeta \\
\Gamma&=\int_{0}^{c} \gamma(\zeta)d\zeta    \\
d\Gamma&= \gamma(\zeta)d\zeta                      \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
$d\Gamma$ generates a velocity $dv$ at point P. But since, the aerofoil is thin and slope is small we can practically assusme that the velocity at $P\prime$ is same as $P$.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
dv&=\frac{d\Gamma}{2\pi r}\\
   &=\frac{d\Gamma}{2\pi (\zeta-x)}\\
   &=\frac{\gamma(\zeta)d\zeta}{2\pi(\zeta-x)}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Upon Integrating over the chord c, we get\textemdash\\
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
V&=\int_{0}^{c}\frac{\gamma(\zeta)d\zeta}{2\pi(\zeta-x)}d\zeta\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Slope of the camber line at any point is given by\textemdash
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\frac{dy}{dx}&\approx \alpha+\frac{v}{U_\infty}cos\alpha\\
\frac{dy}{dx}&\approx \alpha+\frac{1}{2\pi U_\infty}\int_{0}^{c}\frac{\gamma(\zeta)d\zeta}{2\pi(\zeta-x)}d\zeta
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
The equation of the camber line of a given aerofoil is known to us and so its slope. So,in a more rhetoric way,we can say that, corresponding to any $\alpha$ we get at least one $\gamma$ or $\Gamma$.\\
But, intuitively, there must be a unique $\Gamma$ for a given angle of attack. Otherwise, we can imagine ourselves flying past Florida!
Hence, for a given angle of attack, $\exists$ infinite number of valid theoritical solutions, corresponding to infinite choices of $\Gamma$.\\
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Nature knows how to pick up a solution over an infinite set of different potential flow solutions.\\
Only that particular solution is allowed for which the flow is smoothly leaving the top and bottom surfaces of the aerofoil at the trailing edge. This is known as $Kutta$ $Condition$.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{exampleblock}{Kutta-Condition}For a given aerofoil at a given angle of attack, the value of $\Gamma$ around the aerofoil is such that the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly.
\end{exampleblock}
Note- Kutta condition is a consequence of viscosity.\\
How?\\
If there is no viscosity, then there will be no circulation (Kutta-Condition) and there will be no lift.\\
Hence, there is viscous friction, no matter how small. There will be a no-slip condition at the aerofoil surface.\\
Kutta-condition is a occurs at steady state.

\begin{frame}{Kelvin's Theorem and Starting vortex}
\begin{theorem}{\textbf{Kelvin's Circulation Theorem}}
For an irrotational flow whose density is either constant or a function of pressure, as we follow a given closed circuit , the circulation does not change.
\end{theorem}
\textit{Proof}\\
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
 \Gamma&=\oint \vec{V}.d\vec{r}\\
\frac{D\Gamma}{Dt}&=\frac{D}{Dt}(\oint \vec{V}.d\vec{r})\\
&=\oint(\frac{D\vec{V}}{Dt}.dr+\vec{V}.\frac{Dd\vec{r}}{Dt})\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
As $\frac{D\vec{V}}{Dt}$ can be written as \textemdash 
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\frac{D\vec{V}}{Dt}&=\frac{-\nabla P}{\rho}+\vec{b}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
The above eq. is \textbf{Euler Equation for inviscid flow} and it can be derived from \textit{The Navier-Stokes Eq.}\\
So, we have\textemdash
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\frac{D{\Gamma}}{Dt}&= \oint(\frac{-\nabla P}{\rho}+\vec{g}).d\vec{r}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
The terms inside the parentheses is an exact differential. As we know that line integral of a gradient is zero over a closed loop.
\\
So, we get \textemdash
\\
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\frac{D{\Gamma}}{Dt}&= 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Hence, $\Gamma$ is constant all over the flow.Proved.

\begin{frame}{Crux of the spiel}
As the fluid begin to move from rest, a starting vortex is formed near to the trailing edge. It is a vortex sheet. With time, this vortex sheet sheds away from the trailing edge and moves with the flow with its circulation decreasing. \\
Now, to be consistent with the Kelvin's Theorem, a \textit{Bound Vortex} developes around the aerofoil. \\
Its circulation increases with time until it comes to a steady state.\\
In steady state, the starting vortex vanishes and the bound vortex gains a strength of $\gamma$. \\
Kutta-condition is finally achieved.
At all the times, the sum of the circulation of both, viz., \textbf{Bound Vortex} and the \textbf{Starting Vortex} is zero. [\textbf{Kelvin's Theorem}.]
